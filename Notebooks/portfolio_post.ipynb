    "Create a habitat suitability model for \n",
    "[*Juniperus scopulorum* Sargent](https://plants.usda.gov/DocumentLibrary/factsheet/pdf/fs_jusc2.pdf), \n",
    "a tree native to the Rocky Mounatin Region of North America. This habitat suitability \n",
    "model will focus on creating a modular, reproducible workflow. While climate change \n",
    "has changed or taken away suitable habitats for some plant species, the Rocky Mountain Juniper \n",
    "has remained stable and is even expaning habitat areas eastward (Hanberry, B., 2022). However, \n",
    "this is at the expense of other ecosystems. Some climate change scenarios \n",
    "predict up to 90% loss of suitable habitats native grass species like *Sorghastrum nutans* \n",
    "(Kane et al., 2017). So, when thinking about grassland restoration, the \n",
    "effects of climate change and expanding species like *Juniperus scopulorum* \n",
    "Sargent must be taken into consideration for long-term viability of \n",
    "other plant species and ecosystems. This project will choose two study areas - National \n",
    "Grasslands, one in southern Colorado - Comanche National Grassland, and one in \n",
    "Nothern Colorado - Pawnee National Grassland. Both of these National Grasslands are \n",
    "in the Eastern Plains of Colorado which are to the east of the Rocky Mountains. The \n",
    "model used will be based on combining multiple data layers related to soil, topography, \n",
    "and climate (as raster layers) within the study area envelope (the two grasslands chosen).\n",

    "## **Plant Species Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Juniperus scopulorum* Sargent, also known as Rocky Mountain Juniper \n",
    "Tree, is a coniferous tree that slowly grows to about 20 feet at 20 years \n",
    "but can grow up to 50 feet mature (Characteristics of *Juniperus* \n",
    "*scopulorum* Sarg., USDA, NRCS). It also has a long life span with \n",
    "high drought tolerance which works to its favor in semi-airid climates \n",
    "like that of the Eastern Colorado Plains (Characteristics of \n",
    "*Juniperus scopulorum* Sarg., USDA, NRCS). It is native to North America \n",
    "throughout the Rocky Mountain region between British Colombia and Alberta,\n",
    "Canada all the way south through the continental U.S. to the four corners\n",
    "states and east through some of the Great Plains states (Stevens, 2008). \n",
    "The Rocky Mountain juniper grows best below elevations of 7,500 feet, \n",
    "but typically between 3,000 and 7,500 feet (Plant Materials Program, 2002). \n",
    "While the Rocky Mountain juniper is frequently used as an ornamental \n",
    "tree or shrub tree in wildlife plantings and shelterbelts, it is also \n",
    "used by a range of birds and mammals for its ground cover or nesting \n",
    "materials. The Rocky Mountain junipers' berries also provide an important \n",
    "part of both bird and mammal diets. Additionaly, First Peoples have \n",
    "used this berries from this juniper for tea and other applications \n",
    "for medicinal purposes (Stevens, 2008). Some potential problems or concerns \n",
    "about this tree/shrub tree are that it carries cedar-apple rust disease which \n",
    "is not harmful to itself but is harmful to other tree species (Plant \n",
    "Materials Program, 2002). Beyond diseases, the Rocky Mountain juniper increases \n",
    "are \"at the expense of other ecosystems, such as shrublands, grasslands, \n",
    "riparian forests, and open pine and oak forests, with consequent impacts on \n",
    "plant and wildlife species that flourish in open or unique ecosystems\" \n",
    "(Hanberry, B., 2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "This species was chosen because of its prevelance in both the Pawnee National \n",
    "Grassland and the Comanche National Grassland. For the Pawnee National Grassland, \n",
    "the 'General Technical Report' from the USDA, Forest Service on *Vascular Plant* \n",
    "*Species of the Pawnee National Grassland* states that the *Juniperus scopulorum* \n",
    "Sargent occurs in the cliffs and ravines of this National Grassland (Hazlett, \n",
    "1998). Similarly in the Comanche National Grassland, this same type of technical \n",
    "report states that *Juniperus scopulorum* Sargent occurs in all 3 counties \n",
    "(Baca, Otero, and Las Animas Counties) that this grassland is in, which also \n",
    "grow in \"shaded rocky canyons and ravines\" and \"Rocky: exposed limestone/shale \n",
    "barrens\" (Hazlett, 2004). Because this species is expanding habitats, I am curious \n",
    "to see what the outcome of the habitat suitability model will be. \n",
    "This project could be done with any plant species of choice and could \n",
    "even be adapted to animal habitat suitability, but using other datasets \n",
    "and variables that would pertain to that species or locations of study areas chosen. \n",
    "\n",
    "Considering its growth conditions, *Juniperus scopulorum* Sargent has optimal \n",
    "pH values between 8.5 (max) and 5 (min), and precipitation between 26 inches \n",
    "and 9 inches (Characteristics of *Juniperus scopulorum* Sarg., USDA, NRCS). \n",
    "While there are other factors that could be taken into consideration for growth, \n",
    "those are the two variables that will be chosen for this project. These variables \n",
    "will be further discussed in the 'Data Description' section. To look at other \n",
    "growth condition factors as well as additional information about \n",

    "The Comanche National Grassland \"is named in honor of the Comanche tribe. \n",
    "The Comanche name is believed to be derived from Komontcia, a Ute word that\n",
    "means 'People Who Fight Us All the Time' (Pritzker 2000). This nickname, \n",
    "assigned by the Utes, reflects the Comanche reputation among other tribes \n",
    "and among pioneers as fierce fighters\" (Hazlett, 2004, pg. 3). Between the \n",
    "18th and 19th centuries there were many 'claims' to this land where the \n",
    "Comanche National Grassland currently is situated by absentee ownership \n",
    "of the U.S., France, and Mexico, but by 1853 the Comanche were 'asked' \n",
    "(forced) to sign a 'treaty', which ceded any remaining lands that were \n",
    "not previously ceded (taken)(Hazlett, 2004, pages 1-4). Thus the \n",
